Hometown is always the place where precious memories are recorded. Everyone are willing to devote themselves to making their hometown a better place. My hometown is a small but elegant city lying beside the Dongting Lake, but the booming industry and upheaval of life style have driven its beauty away. More measures should be taken to change this situation.

The primary serious problem is water pollution. A paper mill is pouring waste water with poisonous chemicals into the Lake directly, numerous dead fish bodies mixed with white and yellow bubbles are floating on large area of the Lake. To change this, the following strategies should be adopted: High-efficiency water purification equipments should be forced to be installed to the paper mill, more eco-friendly industry standards need to be promulgated and the government ought to found a dedicated office to monitor, supervise and punish. Only in this way could a clear and beautiful lake return to my hometown.

Another bothering problem is air pollution. People enjoys the wealth brought by the prosperity of economics. cars are roaring on the narrow streets, while riding bicycles are regarded as an out life style. The exhaust from cars are flooding the city, and the mask becomes necessary when taking a walk along the streets. It just takes no more than an hour to drive around the whole city, riding should be the preferred choice. So people should be reminded of the genesis of polluted air, ads and slogans could be a horn to wake every citizens up to face this problem. Besides, building a healthy life style is urgently needed: riding or sharing cars should be advocated, and it's also benefited to optimize the public transportations service to attract more passengers. When blue sky and fresh air come back to this city, people won't regret their leaving from filthy vehicles. 

Hometown is where dreams start, every citizens have the responsibility to keep this dream place from the intrusion of polluted water and air.
