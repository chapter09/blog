categories:

Hometown is always the place where precious memories are recorded. Everyone are willing to devote themselves to making their hometown a better place. My hometown is a small but elegant city lying beside the Lake Dongting, but the booming industry and upheaval of life style have driven its beauty away. More measures should be taken to change this situation.

The primary serious problem is water pollution. A paper mill is pouring waste water with poisonous chemicals into the Lake directly, numerous dead fish bodies mixed with white and yellow bubbles are floating on large area of the Lake. To change this, the following strategies should be adopted: 1. The following High-efficiency water purification equipments should be forced to be installed to the paper mill; 2.More eco-friendly industry standards need to be promulgated; 3. The government ought to found a dedicated office to monitor, supervise and punish. Only in this way could a clear and beautiful lake return to my hometown.

Another bothering problem is air pollution. People enjoys the wealth brought by the prosperity of economics. cars are roaring on the narrow streets, while riding bicycles are regarded as an out life style. 

It just takes no more than an hour to drive around the whole city, riding i

 crowd cars do not only bring in more waiting time, but also produce smoke into the air. But people can not live without air, but the air is no longer fresh any more, you are unwilling to breath, but you have to. To change this, I hope that more bicycles will be introduced into people's life, which actually represents a style of green lifestyle. And it's acceptable to ride to some place in this small city.
