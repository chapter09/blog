	Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
	
	In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.


Along with the development of our city and technology, more and more terrestrial area become cities. A car plays an important role in people's daily life, like taking kids to school and take foods from supermarket. In my perspective, in twenty years, there will be more cars, because cars are necessary tools for living a convenient.

First of all, less traffic jams and more convenience with traffic system is developed. Nowadays, owning a car does not equal to having a easy and happy life. In big city like Beijing or Shanghai, there is high possibility to meet traffic jams and even accidents. It seems taking public transportations to go to work will save more time. Thus, terrible traffic make people think twice when buy a car. However, in twenty years our traffic system will be much smarter and its capacity will be extended. People will be more willing to purchase a car and drive it feely, without considering evade the traffic congestion or worrying about traffic accidents. While the future transportation construction can support enough cars to run fast and safely, we can believe people will definitely enjoy their elegant life on the wheels.

Additionally, more people can afford a car with the highly efficient future industry. We are embracing another technique revolution in twenty years. Automatic robots will replace human being in factories. Automobiles will be cheap enough for every to have one. Private cars shorten the distances between friends and families. In China, when the Spring Festival comes, people will get together to celebrate. However, the flight tickets or train tickets will be in short as China has a huge population. In twenty years, more cars will help people go through the long distances and have a happy family reunion.

Cars do not pollute any more, because cars powered by electricity will preveal around the world.
