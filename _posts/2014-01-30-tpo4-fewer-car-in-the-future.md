	Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
	
	In twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.


Along with the growth of our city and technology, more and more terrestrial area becomes cities. A car plays an important role in people's daily life, like taking kids to school and take foods from the supermarket. In my perspective, in twenty years, there will be more cars, because cars are necessary tools for living a convenient.

First of all, less traffic jams and more convenience with traffic system is developed. Nowadays, owning a car does not equal to having an easy and happy life. In a big city like Beijing or Shanghai, there is a high possibility to meet traffic jams and even accidents. It seems taking public transportations to go to work will save more time. Thus, terrible traffic makes people think twice when buy a car. However, in twenty years, along with the transportation facilities developing, our traffic system will be much smarter and its capacity will be extended. Besides, equipped with new driving systems, cars will be smarter and safer. A future smart car senses all the objects around on the road, it is not only able to recognise the barriers and slow down or evade automatically, but also senses and predicts the status of roads to the destination. People will be more willing to purchase a car and drive it freely, without considering evade the traffic congestion or worrying about traffic accidents. We can believe people will definitely enjoy their elegant life on the wheels.

Additionally, more people can afford a car with future highly developed automobile industries. We are embracing another technique revolution in twenty years. Automatic robots will replace human beings in factories. Automobiles will be cheap enough for everyone to have one, while basic facilities like highways and bridges are also well build and scheduled. Private cars shorten the distances between friends and families. In China, when the Spring Festival comes, people will gather to celebrate. However, the flight tickets or train tickets will be in short as China has a huge population. In twenty years, more cars will help people go through a long distance and have a warm and sweet family reunion.

Meanwhile, in twenty years, more cars will not mean more air pollution. With cars powered by electricity prevailing around the world, the roads will be quiet and clean. Because electric cars have a completely different engine with traditional gasoline cars, there is no burning at all in electric engines. That's why an electric car can perform as excellent as a gasoline car while no noise and polluted gas are produced. Thus, there is no reason for people to refuse such an eco-friendly and powerful car.

In twenty years, our techniques and facilities are both upgraded, cars will be much cheaper, smarter and friendly to the environment, while roads are widened. A car makes it possible to reach the destination freely and comfortably. It's reasonable to believe that there will be more cars in the future.
