	Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
	It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. 
	Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.


How to help student develop a scientific learning method is a hot discussion topic for teachers and students. Nowadays students are faced with tremendous volume of knowledge and information, there is not enough time to dive into the facts. From my perspective, mastering the stem ideas and concepts are more practical and reasonable.

First and foremost, understanding the major ideas and concepts is the prerequisite for a student to learn a variety of cases. Ideas and concepts will lead students to understand real cases. Ideas depict the common structure or logic of different cases, while concepts explain the key components of the facts. That's the reason why the explanation of terminologies and abstract introduction will put in the front in most technical booklets. Thus, students should digest the ideas and concepts first, or they will get confused or lost in endless cases.

Additionally, concluding ideas and concepts from the facts is not easy. Admittedly, most of our current ideas and concepts are concluded from the facts. For an instance, the great physicist Newton invented the Newton First Principle when he was hit an dropping apple, which is an example that people obtain the ideas and concepts from the facts. Nevertheless, there is no denying that not every one could find the principle by watching an apple which drops from the tree. Therefore, for most students, it's more realistic to understand the ideas and concepts.

To put it in the nutshell, ideas and concepts are the basis of knowledge, while most facts could be explained by ideas and concepts. At the same time, it's not easy for students to infer or conclude ideas and concepts from various facts. With above observations, comprehending the ideas and concepts are much more important for students.
