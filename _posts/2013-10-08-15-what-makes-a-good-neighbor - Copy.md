My neighbors were like a big family in my childhood. They were willing to help each other and enjoyed sharing their delicious homemade food. Even now I still miss my good neighbors. My childhood memory cannot be sweet without them. From my experience, a good neighbor should be warmhearted and good at cooking. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A good neighbor never hesitates to give a hand. They do their best to help but ask for nothing. While I was a child, my parents had to occasionally work overtime and came back home at night. Like most children, I was so frightened by the darkness and silence of night that I would turn on the television and kept it loud. Fortunately, my considerate neighbor knocked on my door and invited me to their house. We watched TV and had snacks together, which was a pleasurable time for me. When my parents picked me up, my neighbor told my parents that they were glad to have me stay with them when my parents left for work. Thanks to my neighbor's help, my parents did not need to worry about me at their work, while there was no more lonely and fearful nights for me since then. With a helpful neighbor, our life become much easier.

Meanwhile, excellent culinary skills are critical for a nice neighbor. Tasty food gains people's admiration and respect. People can hardly reject yummy food from a neighbor. Every time my family moved to a new place, my mum would like to make some palatable cookies and asked me to deliver to our neighbors. Though some neighbors could not recognize me at the first sight, after my self-introduction, they were pleased to taste the cookies and gave my family warm welcome. They even asked my family to join dinner with them. It was my mum's superb cooking skills that made my family popular around our neighborhood. Thus, delicious food helps a lot in developing harmony relationships between neighbors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A good neighbor does not only offer a lot of help, but also bring more joy into neighborhood with toothsome food.  Indeed, a good neighbor plays an important role in our daily life.
