As many other inventions created by human beings, movies and television have positive influence as well as negative influence on people's behavior. Just like the moon has a bright side, while never loses its dark side. Besides, movies and television exist in every phases of people's life. No matter what kind of influence movies and television bring with, there is no doubt that their influence is great. 

The positive influence is obvious. As a primary information source, movies and television delivery mass of knowledge and happiness to public. News programs tell people what happens around the world right now; Ads from fashion brands remind the consumers; Movies and TV series sweep people's tiredness away after their work; Cartoons not only comfort crying babies, but also educate them. Until today, I still remember those cartoon characters from the television in childhood, such as "Tom and Jerry" and "Popeye". While they made me laugh, they taught me to be aware of the difference between goodness and badness.

However the negative influence could not be ignored.
