As many other inventions created by human beings, movies and television have positive influence as well as negative influence on people's behavior. Just like the moon has a bright side as well as a dark side. Besides, movies and television exist in every phases of people's lives. No matter what kind of influence movies and television bring with, there is no doubt that the influence is great. 

The positive influence is obvious. As a primary information source, mass of knowledge and happiness is delivered via movies and television to public. News programs tell people what happens around the world right now; ads from fashion brands remind the consumers; movies and TV series sweep people's tiredness away after their work; cartoons not only comfort crying babies, but also educate them. Until today, I still remember those cartoon characters from the television in childhood, such as "Tom and Jerry" and "Popeye". While they made me laugh, they taught me to be aware of the difference between goodness and badness.

Nevertheless, the negative influence could not be ignored. What the movies and television provide are not all healthy, bloody, sexual and race discrimination content could never be destroyed or filtered. With those images and plots presented on the screen, people and especially teenagers' minds are corrupted. It is said numerous teenagers smoke because their stars smoke in the movies or TV series, and they fight as the fightings in the movies are regarded a cool solution. What's worse, large numbers of people become the slaves of TV or movies. They put an end to their social life and spend all the time on endless TV programs, who are defined as "couch-potato" generation. TV programs take place of their friends and families, but take away their health, which will result in a serious society problems.

Movies and television are productions of human's intelligence. But if people could not aware the coexistence of the positive influence and negative influence, only troubles could they reap from those productions.
