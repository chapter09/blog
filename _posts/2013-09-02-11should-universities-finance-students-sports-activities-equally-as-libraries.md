In most people's perspective, universities are where knowledge is reproduced and spread. In universities, libraries are especially important for offering tremendous amount of books and materials to students. However, compared with offering academical resources for the brains, caring for health of the bodies should be taken into consideration seriously. Thus, students' sports activities and libraries should be put to the each side of a scale.

"To work healthily for motherland for 50 years" is a motivating slogan from a top university in China. It advocates an idea that students should not only dig deep in their major, but also build their tough body via all kinds of sports activities. A strong body could defend against all possible illnesses, difficulties in students' following life time, thus they could keep high performance to pursuit their success. To realize this goal, universities need invest in hiring teachers of different sports activities, building various sports equipments and making education plans of sports. Actually all the investment, including money, time and human resources, will not be less than running libraries. But it's worthy indeed.

In fact, investment for the students' sports activities is the investment for students' long-term career, and in return, students' success will lead the university to success. I have a friend called Kevin, who works in accounting firm, which is a place full of endless tasks, competitions and pressure. Form most reports of newspapers or magazines, the author always describe accounting firms as the hell, staffs keep working in the mid-night, sleep for no more than 4 hours etc. But every time I meet with my friend, he is energetic and in good spirits, even after working all night long. Kevin does not have any elixir, he just spend his spare time in running or playing some ping-pong as he was trained to do those sports activities in his university time. Kevin has a colleague Tom who graduated from a another university. Tom lives in a totally different way from Kevin, he prefers to reading in a chair for a whole day rather than doing some sports. Tom worked hard in his early years in this firm, but heavy tasks and pressure nearly take his health away. While Kevin got promoted, Tom had stayed in a hospital for a month, as he got much pain in his spine.

It's obvious to learn from Kevin and Tom's story that students' sports activities are of the same importance with libraries. If Tom had found his interest in sports in his university time, he would have a strong body and a healthy life style.
