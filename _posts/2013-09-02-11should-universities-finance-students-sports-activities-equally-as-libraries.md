In most people's perspective, universities are where knowledge is reproduced and spread. Besides, education and research projects rely on libraries, which offer tremendous amount of books and materials. However, compared with offering academic resources for the brains, caring for health of the bodies should also be taken into consideration seriously. Thus, students' sports activities and libraries should be put to the each side of a scale.

"To work healthily for motherland for 50 years" is a motivating slogan from a top university in China. It advocates an idea that students should not only dig deep in their major, but also build their tough body via sports practice. A strong body could defend against possible illnesses, difficulties in students' following life, in result, they could keep high performance to pursuit their success. To achieve this goal, universities need hire more teachers of different sports activities, build various sports equipments and make education plans of sports. Actually, all the investment including human resources, money, and time, will not be less than running libraries. But it's worthy indeed.

In fact, the investment for the students' sports activities is the investment for a life-long career of students. I have a friend called Kevin, who works in an accounting firm. From most newspapers or magazines, the author always describe accounting firms as the hell, staffs keep working in the mid-night and obtain less than 4 hours sleep time. But every time I meet with Kevin, he is energetic and in good spirits, even after all night long work. Kevin does not have any elixir, he just spends his spare time in running or playing some ping-pong, as he was trained to do so in his university time. Kevin has a colleague named Tom. Tom graduated from a different university. Tom lives in a totally different way from Kevin, he prefers to reading in a sofa for an whole day rather than doing some sports after he finishes his work. Tom also worked very hard, but with heavier and complexes works, finally he could not afford them. While Kevin got promoted, Tom had stayed in a hospital for nearly a month, as he got much pain in his spine.

It's obvious to learn from Kevin and Tom's story that students' sports activities are of the same importance as libraries. If Tom had found his interest in sports in his university time, he would  probably have a strong body and a healthy life style.
