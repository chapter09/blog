In my childhood, my neighbors were like a big family. They were willing to help each other and enjoyed sharing their delicious homemade food. Even now I still miss my good neighbors. My childhood memory cannot be sweet without them. From my experience, a good neighbor is warmhearted and good at cooking. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A good neighbor never hesitates to give a hand. They do their best to help and ask for nothing. While I was a child, my parents occasionally had to work overtime and came back home at night. Like most children, I were so frightened by the darkness and silence of night that I would turn on the television and kept it loud. Fortunately, my kind neighbor knocked my door and invited me to their house. We watched TV series and had snacks together, which was a enjoyable  time. After that, my neighbor told my parents that they were glad to have me stay with them when my parents left for work. Thanks to my neighbor's help, my parents did not need to worry about me at their work, while there was no lonely and fearful night for me any more.
