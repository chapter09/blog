&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In my childhood, my neighbors were like a big family. They were willing to help each other and enjoyed sharing their delicious homemade food. Even now I still miss my good neighbors. My childhood memory cannot be sweet without them. From my experience, a good neighbor is warmhearted and good at cooking. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A good neighbor never hesitates to give a hand. They do their best to help but ask for nothing. While I was a child, my parents occasionally had to work overtime and came back home at night. Like most children, I was so frightened by the darkness and silence of night that I would turn on the television and kept it loud. Fortunately, my considerate neighbor knocked on my door and invited me to their house. We watched TV and had snacks together, which was a pleasurable time for me. When my parents picked me up, my neighbor told my parents that they were glad to have me stay with them when my parents left for work. Thanks to my neighbor's help, my parents did not need to worry about me at their work, while there was no more lonely and fearful nights for me since then.

Meanwhile, excellent culinary skills is critical for a good neighbor. Tasty food not only allows people experience amazing taste, but also makes people respect and favor the cooker. People can hardly reject yummy food from a neighbor. Every time my family moved to a new place, my mum would like to make some palatable cookies and asked me to deliver to our neighbors. Though some neighbors could not recognize me at first sight. After my self-introduction, they were pleased to taste the cookies and gave my family warm welcome, even they asked my family to join dinner with them. It was my mum's superb cooking skills that made my family popular around our neighborhood. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are less trouble because a good neighbor is fairly helpful, while there are more joy as a good neighbor makes toothsome food. In my mind, these qualities make a good neighbor. A good neighbor indeed plays an important role in our daily life.
