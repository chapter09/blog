	Neighbors are the people who live near us. In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good neighbor? Use specific details and examples in your answer.
	

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a child, my neighbors were like a big family. They were willing to help and enjoyed sharing their delicious homemade food. Even now I still miss my good neighbors. My childhood memory cannot be sweet without them. From my experience, a good neighbor is warm-hearted and good at cooking. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary quality of a good neighbor is a natural willingness to help. When I was a child, my parents â€¦ I will stay with my neighbors , wait for my parents come back. 




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, good at cooking. 




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want a good neighbor, also to be a good neighbor for others.
