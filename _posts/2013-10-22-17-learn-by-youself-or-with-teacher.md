In majority people's mind, a teacher is a professional person who talks about science or liberal art in before students. Some students are used to following teachers' instructions, as the instructions are useful hints for study; while some are more willing to think and practice independently, because they enjoy the process of searching unknown aspects. For me, I prefer to learn by myself, but also keep touch with my teacher.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Teachers are not omnipotent. Different students have their own ways to process information, because of their different backgrounds and personalities. In a result, no matter how experience a teacher is, he or she cannot take all the hinders students might meet into consideration. Thus, most teachers educate and guide students based on general cases without considering students' specific characteristics. When I was in my primary school, I had a friend who often asked strange questions and made our teacher feel awkward. Then our teacher regarded him as a naughty boy and ignored his questions. My friend didn't deserve that only because he insisted on his unique view. A teacher also makes mistakes, it takes risk for students who only listen to their teacher.

Students benefit a lot from learning by themselves. A survey on Top 10 universities in China shows that nearly 82.3% of students finish their courses by self-learning. By self-learning students make decisions on what and how to learn all by themselves, and no longer need to deal with potential repeated information from teachers. Self-learning not only saves time, but also inspires students to think and innovate independently. The great physicist Albert Einstein liked skipping his classes occasionally, as he said, this bought him essential time to learn and imagine freely. Learning without a teacher standing nearby definitely gives remarkable inspirations to students.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, a teacher does own plenty of invaluable experience. Though teachers may not be considerate for any students, teachers still cannot be completely replaced. They have enough experience to give a student a clear direction when he or she has no idea about their study. It's worthwhile and necessary to have a periodic talk with teachers. The famous computer scientist Turing has a habit of taking notes during his reading when he got an idea. When he collected two or three pages of ideas, he asked his teacher to discuss with him. His teacher's advices became  in his lifetime.
