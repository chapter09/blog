Some students are used to following teachers' instructions, as those instructions are useful hints for study; while some are more willing to think and practice independently, because they enjoy the process of searching unknown aspects. For me, I prefer to learn by myself, but also keep touch with my teacher.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Self-learning is a high-efficient method  . Different student has different ways to understand. No matter how experience a teacher is, he or she cannot recognize each of those problems the students meet with. Thus, most teachers do not offer specific education  


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A teacher owns plenty of invaluable experience.

A new restaurant built in our neighborhood should be supported and welcomed. It brings more appetizing food and pushes other restaurants to promote themselves. People have more opportunities to try various kinds of food and experience optimized service. However, with restaurants getting more and more popular, their noise and garbage may also have a side effect over our neighborhood.
