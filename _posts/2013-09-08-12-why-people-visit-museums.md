人们以不同的理由去新的地方旅行。其中最普遍的原因便是去观光新的地方，体验不同的文化和生活方式。 对于短暂停留的外地游客，博物馆通过特别设计的教学形式，人文见识以及娱乐的形式提供这些生活方式的掠影。

人们来到博物馆来认识这个世界。博物馆的学习体验与阅读或者上学完全不同。在博物馆中，学习体验是直接而刺激的。 阅读关于原始历史的书籍可能十分枯燥，但是亲眼看到恐怖恐龙的巨大骨架绝对是令人振奋而深刻的体验。阅读关于南京大屠杀的书籍令人恐怖，悲伤却又抽象，而一次南京纪念馆的参观则是令许多学生留下热泪的经历。博物馆还能使其他一些遥远而平凡的教育体验变得生动真实。

一个地方的博物馆能够告诉外来客们很多关于当地人在人文上珍视的东西。一次美国大都会艺术博物馆的参观将告诉游客美国人多么珍惜来自全世界的艺术品，但是把其欧洲艺术品和亚洲艺术品的收藏规模作对比，又游客也行会总结出美国人在文化层面上对于欧洲艺术更亲近。同样的，在去三番市的旅行里，从那里一座只收藏亚洲艺术品的博物馆也许能得出三番市民对于亚洲文化更为亲近。

于此同时，也有很多人旅行只是单纯为了放松和愉悦身心，博物馆是一个休闲的好地方。甚至大部分旨在教育的博物馆也设有令人兴奋的景点，比如影院，特殊文化展示如舞蹈、美食、讲座，还有音乐表演从爵士乐到摇滚乐。很多美国博物馆每周都会举办特别的狂欢夜，年轻人可以在此畅饮和社交。博物馆不仅仅因为文化和教育而存在，还是十分重要的娱乐交际场所。

'_' underline parts are phrases or words still with doubts 

People start a trip to a new place for various purposes. Some travel for experiencing different culture, history and art, some for entertainments and relaxing themselves. Therefore, a local museum becomes a good choice for visitors who <u>just set foot on</u> the new land.

The museum is a place storing all kinds of records and memories. <u>A walk</u> in a museum <u>helps</u> people experience life styles in old times, like how ancient people cook and what they wore. People always learn much more from those real collections than books or videos. For travelers to Xi'an in Shanxi Province, Shanxi Museum is the destination which cannot be missed. It keeps different kinds of arms dating back to the Qin Dynasty. What's the most impressive is that some swords are still shining and sharp,<u> though,</u> after thousands of years. Besides, <u>shocked and fascinated,</u> when visitors are facing to thousands of Terra-Cotta Warriors, which <u>are from</u> the tomb of the First Emperor of Qin. However, media such as the TV and books can hardly illustrate that the pottery technology had been developed tremendously in the Qin Dynasty. Museums open a passage to the past<u>, then</u> visitors learn and experience the ancient life there. 

Except for educational attractions, a museum is also a nice place for relaxing and entertainments. The majority of museums are equipped with advanced movie theaters where people could watch selected movies. There are also fascinating performances like traditional operas and dances. For instance, Beijing Museum invites famous Peking Opera actors and actresses to perform the evolution of Peking Opera regularly. Visitors from all over the world not only get an opportunity to catch a glimpse of this old Chinese art style closely, but also enjoy themselves in the excellent performance. Besides, it's an easy and pleasing shopping experience and those exquisite custom-made souvenirs will leave visitors <u>unforgettable memories</u>.

Meanwhile, some people with no specific destinations will also enjoy themselves and get relaxed. Wandering in the museum is an unordinary amazing journey, for most museum buildings are designed as a piece of art. Shanghai Historical Museum is placed in Shanghai People's Park. With blossom flowers <u>here and there in</u> the park, the museum in ancient castle design will definitely appeal to you no matter whether you have a purpose or not. Nowadays, museums are not only about the history and culture, but also a good place to <u>drop by</u> and relax.
