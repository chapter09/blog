	Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.

Transportation system plays an important role in people's daily life. It indeed saves plenty of time for people to go to work and travel around. Compared with public transportation, driving by oneself may be far more comfortable and convenient. Actually the situation seems to be the opposite in crowed cities. In my opinion, governments should invest more on improving public transportation.

Public transportation offers an excellent solution for crowed cities. Nowadays more and more people live or work in cities, while every city has a limited capacity for population. Along with people keep coming into a city, streets become crowed and it takes much more time for drivers to wait for a green light. It's obvious that construction of roads or highways cannot catch up with the increase rate of citizens. However, improving the public transportation not only helps <> in traffics, but also reduces the production of noise, gases and even traffic jams. One year ago, the new mayor of London started a tax called "crowed tax". The "crowed tax" was planed to used to build more roads. Now this proposal seems to be a failure at all, as London is still a crowed city making citizens awkward. Public transportation serves more people and contributes more to our environment.

Roads and highways are potential threats to nature. Numerous animals are killed on highways every year, while roads are still stretching into animals' habitats. Constructing a road has to sacrifice a lot from ecosystem. A road may cut off a migration path of deers, or destroy a homelike cave for rabbits. Large scale of trees are pulled down and fertile ground is covered with thick and heavy concrete. In Australia there is a kind of cute creature called Koala, and their average lifetime is about 12 years. According to a survey by scientist, Koalas living near highways or humans' residence only have an average lifetime of two to three years. Most Koalas died for car accidents and ruined habitats. Thus it's not worthy to take our natural environment to trade for .

Taking public transportation contributes to developing an environmentally friendly city. The prosperity of a city depends on its public . Besides, more roads and highways brings more cars and disasters for ecosystem. In short, it's fairly a wiser choice for governments to purchase for public transportation.
