	Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The transportation system of a city plays an important role in citizens' daily life. It indeed offers a great deal of convenience for people to go to work and travel around. Compared with public transportation, driving by oneself may be far more comfortable except for driving on a congested road. In my opinion, governments should spend more on improving public transportation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Public transportation serves more people but consumes less resource. Nowadays people keep seeking for a living in cities, while every city has a limited capacity for population. Along with increasing urban population, roads and streets become crowded and frequent traffic jams make driving suffering. The construction speed of roads and highways cannot match the increase rate of private cars. However, promoting the service of public transportation not only attracts more people to take buses and subways, but also reduces cars stuck in a congested road. At the same time, noise and automobile exhaust are mitigated enormously because less cars are running in the city. Years ago, the mayor of London started a fee for most motor vehicles called "congestion charge", which was arranged to invest to enhance roads. Now this policy seems to be a failure, as London is still an overburden city. Public transportation is obviously beneficial for most people and helps to improve our environment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Roads and highways are potential threats to nature. Numerous animals are killed on highways every year. Building a road has to sacrifice the whole ecosystem around. A road may cut off the migration path of deers, or destroy a homelike cave for rabbits. Large scale of trees are pulled down and fertile ground is covered with thick and heavy concrete. In Australia there is a kind of cute creatures called Koala, and their average lifetime is about 10 years. Nonetheless, according to a survey by scientist, Koalas living near highways or human's residences only live up to about 2 to 3 years. Most Koalas died for car accidents and ruined habitats. Spending more on improving roads result in catastrophe upon environment. Thus, it's not worthwhile to exchange harmony nature for development of roadways.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Public transportation covers the needs of most citizens and remarkably contributes to developing an environmentally friendly city. Besides, more roads and highways bring more cars and disasters for ecosystem. In short, it's fairly a wiser choice for governments to purchase for public transportation. With governments' more input to public transportation, buses and subways will be more pleasant and satisfying for passengers.
