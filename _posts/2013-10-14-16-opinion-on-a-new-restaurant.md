New flavors are extremely appealing to people's appetite and curiosity. Some people travel even around just for tasting distinctive delicacies. A new restaurant does not only offer an all-new-designed place for meals, but also a variety of attractive yummy dishes. In my opinion, a new restaurant deserves warm welcome from our neighborhood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First of all, a new restaurant comes with fresh tastes. Since many years, people did not have many choices because there were only few restaurants around our neighborhood, what's worse, they seldom updated their menus. For years, people were tired of those restaurants and drove a long way to seek different food. After a new restaurant is built, things becomes different. People rush to the new restaurant, review the menus and enjoy themselves. Besides, there is no need for people to go through a long distance for dinner, as it only takes a few walks to have a satisfactory meal. The neighbors are thankful for such a restaurant built in our neighborhood. Thus, more flavors and choices brought in by a new restaurant indeed please the neighbors a lot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Secondly, competition drives old restaurants to refine themselves. With shiny plate and bowl, fashionable decoration and smiling waiters, a brand-new restaurant is obviously an unprecedented competitor for those old ones. On the contrary, in those old restaurants, tables are always sticky with dirt, while spider webs are growing on the ceiling. To upgrade or to die, the outdated restaurants are faced with these two options. They have to do their best to refresh their menus, enhance their service, and redecorate their house. After their reincarnation, they may win their guests back. In result, people experience refined food and convenience service at a low price. From the competition between restaurants, neighbors benefit greatly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A new restaurant built in our neighborhood should be supported and welcomed. It brings more appetizing food and pushes other restaurants to promote themselves. People have more opportunities to try various kinds of food and experience optimized service. However, with restaurants getting more and more popular, their noise and garbage may also have a side effect over our neighborhood.
