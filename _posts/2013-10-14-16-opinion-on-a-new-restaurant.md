New flavors are extremely appealing to people's appetite and curiosity. Even some people travel around just for tasting different food. A new restaurant does not only offer an all-new-designed place, but also a variety of attractive yummy dishes. In my opinion, a new restaurant deserves warm welcome from our neighborhood.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First of all, a new restaurant comes with new tastes. Since many years, people did not have many choices because there were only few restaurants around our neighborhood, what's worse, they seldom updated their menus. People were tired of those restaurants and had to drive a long way to seek different food. However, after a new restaurant is built things becomes different. Its pizzas are made by special ingredients . There is no need for people to go through a long distance for dinner, as it only takes a few walks to enjoy a satisfactory meal. The neighbors are thankful for such a new restaurant built in our neighborhood. Thus, a new restaurant with more flavors indeed please the neighbors a lot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Secondly, competition drives old restaurants to refine themselves. A brand-new restaurant with shiny plate and bowl is obviously a strong competitor for those old ones. The outdated restaurants are faced with two options: to upgrade or die. They have to do their best to refresh their menus, enhance their service, and redecorate their house. After their reincarnation, they may win their guests back. In result, people experience refined food and convenience service at a low price. From the competition between restaurants, neighbors benefit greatly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It's great to have a new ... however, if more and more restaurants come into the neighborhood, it will exceeds its capability and brings more noise and pollution. Over competition.
