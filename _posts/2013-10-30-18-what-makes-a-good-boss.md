	What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As a supervisor, he or she takes care of every employee, and acts as a leader for everyone. It is not easy to become a good boss. I once worked in different companies as an intern, and met with some respected superintendents. __Through my experience__, team spirit and proficient communication skills are the prerequisite to make an excellent supervisor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First of all, team spirit is particularly essential for an outstanding boss. A supervisor is still one part of a team despite his or her extra rights and higher salary. A team's success relies on willingness of service and integral consciousness, which __is__ called team spirit. A leader with a good understanding <strike>in</strike> at team spirit definitely has a profound effect on the whole team. In 2010, I worked as an intern in an software service company. My major work was to collect and organize our users' feedback. In the end of the year, users' emails flooded to me, while <strike>I got a lot of examinations to prepare</strike> I was preparing for many exams. After my managers <strike>was</strike> became aware of my awkward situation, he asked me to share my <strike>works</strike> work with him and __my__ other colleagues. With their assistance, I managed to finish my job in time and got satisfactory scores <strike>in</strike> on the tests. Inspired by our manager, every member in our team was willing to cooperate, which made us a <strike>high-efficient</strike> highly efficient team. Thus, team spirit is a quite necessary quality for a qualified leader.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A promising supervisor has superior communication skills. Most respected bosses are patient and sincere to hear all the words from employees and even their competitors, whether it is <strike>no matter the words are about</strike> criticism or praise. In addition, as a good listener, a boss can quickly understand the topic <strike>talkers seize the topic of the conversation quickly</strike> and gain information <strike> they want</strike>. By <strike>talking</strike> speaking with employees, a caring <strike>careful</strike> boss knows what worries his team and what will help fix it <strike>gives a quick fix</strike>. Once I had a director named Bob. People in our company called him 'Nice Bob' because every week he arranged an whole Friday afternoon for his staffs to chat with him. Bob listened sincerely to his staffs and gave his advice or discussed a solution for them. 'Nice Bob' built a tight relationship with his employees, and he was selected as the most popular employer for many years. In short, a successful supervisor is a considerate listener as well as an attractive speaker.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Team spirit helps a leader build a highly efficient team; practical communication skills improve the relationship between a boss and his or her employees. As we can see, both of the qualities are of great importance to make a good boss and start a successful career.
