	What are some important qualities of a good supervisor(boss)? Use specific details and examples to explain why these qualities are important.
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As a supervisor, he or she takes care of every teammate, and makes a long term plan for a whole team. It is not easy to become a good boss. I once worked in different companies as an intern, and met with some quite successful superintendents. With my experience, team spirit and proficient  communication skills are the prerequisite to make an excellent supervisor.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First of all, team spirit is particularly essential for an outstanding boss.   
A supervisor is still one part of a team despite his or her extra rights and higher salary. A team's success relies on willingness of service and integral consciousness, which is called team spirit. A leader with a well understanding in team spirit definitely has a profound effect on the whole team. In 2010, I worked as an intern in an software service company. My major work was to collect and organize our users' feedback. In the end of the year, users' emails flooded to me, while I got a lot of examinations to prepare. After my managers was aware of my awkward situation, he asked me to share my works with him and other colleagues. With their assistance, I managed to finish my job and get satisfactory scores in the tests. Inspired by our manager, every member in our team was willing to help, which made our team famous around the company. Thus, team spirit is a necessary quality for a qualified leader.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A promising leader is good at communicating with different people. willing to listen all the voices. express ideas and suggestions in way.
