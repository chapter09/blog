&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before I attended high school, I lived in the countryside. My childhood in rural was full of happiness as I was so close to nature. But my horizon was hugely broadened in high school which was located in a big city. From a long term perspective, to grow in a big city or the countryside, it's hard to distinguish which one is better.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In countryside, children are free to explore nature. Nature is like a wizard, who makes colorful flowers boom in spring, frogs sing in summer, fallen leaves  in autumn, and snowflakes drift in winter. Growing in rural areas, children have the opportunity to experience the greatest magic all by themselves. When I was a child, I got a plenty of gifts from nature. My companions and I climbed trees to get tasty mulberry, caught fishes in brooklets and even I had my own garden to plant carrots and cabbages. My countryside life becomes unforgettable memory for me. Talking with my friends growing in cities, they are always attracted by my unique experiences and stories with nature. Nature is also an excellent mentor, taught me to how to observe and respect different lives. By exploring around, I found all the creatures were admirable. As a naughty boy, once I stabbed the honeycomb just for fun, but then bees attacked me with their needles. Though I cried for pain on my back and hands, I still admired those bees, they fought bravely for their home and even sacrificed themselves. After they stung me they would die. It's hardly possible for a child in city to witness the details of nature. children growing in countryside have dozens of opportunities and joy to learn from nature.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Despite of the natural and enjoyable life in countryside, in big cities children understand more about our society. Modern civilization aggregates and evolves in cities. Natural science museums exhibit the origin of lives and a variety of creatures on earth; history museums depict the evolution of our human's society and stories of giant men; public libraries offer millions of books and zoos keep different animals from all over the world. Growing in a big city definitely broadens the horizon of children and builds their ambitions. Generally, compared to children from rural areas, children living a big city are far more adaptive to the high pace of the modern cities, which is helpful for them to make a career in the future. Since that, it makes sense that in China a lot of parents living in countryside make an effort to send their children to study in big cities. I am one of those children, and I started my city life when I joined my high school. In fact, I did have more choices when I made arrangements for my life. Actually, it's quite beneficial for a child to grow in a big city.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Growing in countryside leaves children more space to wander in nature while city lives teach children with solid knowledge and offer them more flexible options. Thus, it's difficult to decide which environment is better for children. Perhaps, spending the childhood in countryside and moving to a big city at school age is a reasonable solution.
