	Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
	Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children.
	Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
	

With the growth of our society and tremendous development of technology and science, life today becomes much easier and comfortable than it was in our grandparents' old days. Along with a variety of modern advanced tools prevailing in our daily lives, like the Internet, GPS navigation and smart phones, the quality of our life is extremely improved when compare with the past.

First and foremost, the appearance of information technology changes the whole world. In China about fifty years ago, most people communicated with each other by mails, which took about days or even months to reach the destination. Although the telegraph might be quick, but it was not cheap and had a limited capacity for words. However, nowadays we have not only telephone, but also mobile phones which allow people to connect each anytime and anywhere. What improves people's lives vastly and completely is the birth of the Internet. People make new friends and talk to each other face-to-face via the Internet, what's more, online supermarkets provide goods from all over the world; search engines offer anything people want to know only with one key word, which seems to be unimaginable when our grandparents were children. Admittedly, information technology makes a surprisingly big difference, and today people are enjoying far more convenient and cozy life.

Additionally, the advancement of medical care helps people live a healthier way than the past. As the WHO's statistical data points out that the average lifetime of human beings worldwide increases years by years. Modern medical treatment not only has important breakthroughs on curing diseases, but also concludes valuable tips on people everyday diets and exercises. Thus, quite a lot of fatal diseases in the past can be cured now, besides, in the light of modern diet study, people now pay more attention to the balance of their daily food. By contrast, our grandparents hardly had detailed concepts about their meals, they cared more about how to fulfil their stomach rather than how to build their body and keep fit. Therefore, under the protection of modern medical care, our bodies function fairly better than old times.

All in all, the human society is definitely advancing towards an easier and more comfortable direction. More and more people will benefit from the development of technology and science. Doubtless our life today is improved largely and unprecedentedly than our grandparents'.
