As I always open a lot of tabs in Chrome, but seldom to close them, my Chrome occupies large size of memory, and tabs also obstruct me when I am looking for the tab  I need.

To solve this problem, a chrome extension could be  help, which could snapshots all the tabs or part of them in current Chrome to a list, the Chrome will cache the URLs of those tabs. When you wanna to re-open the before tabs, you could click the icon of the extension, and it will pop a list, then you could choose what you want.

I am planning to do it.
