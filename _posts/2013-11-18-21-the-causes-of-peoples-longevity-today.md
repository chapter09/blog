Nowadays, the average life expectancy is much longer than one hundred years ago. Living a long life means that one can contribute more to our society, realize more wishes and share more time with his/her family. In my perspective, people's longevity mainly benefits from healthy lifestyle and advanced scientific techniques. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A healthy lifestyle helps modern people build strong and active bodies. Regular physical exercises like running and yoga not only speed up the process of metabolism and accelerate calorie burn, but also strengthen the body to defense diseases and slow down aging. In addition, a balanced diet containing appropriate amount of protein, sugar and fat keeps people stay fit and positive. When I was an intern, my supervisor was a woman who was nearly 50 years old. Nonetheless, it was hardly to tell her age from her appearance because she was so shining and energetic. She told us that her secret was taking a yoga class two times a week and having an apple a day. An apple a day keeps doctor away, as she said. However, in the past people had no such detailed knowledge and ideas for daily food and sports. Modern study on healthy lifestyle indeed offers valuable advice to extend people's lives.
        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Along with the development of science and technology, the quality of people's living condition is well guaranteed. Doctors take advantage of advanced medical techniques to investigate diseases and treat patients. State of art biology techniques can even analyze an individual's DNA sequences by some drops of saliva and find out the related diseases are potentially dangerous for him/her. On the other hand, vehicle companies are updating their technologies to make automobiles safer, consume less oil and generate less noise as well as waste gas. Besides, more and more people accept smart cars driven by electric power. Streets and roads are much cleaner, and there are fewer traffic accidents than before. High quality medical treatments, pleasant and safe environment and so on, make the living surroundings fit for human. Science and technology makes human's life keep going on.
        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In short, under a healthy lifestyle people take care of their body in a more effective way. Further more, modern science and technology offers more methods and possibilities to extend people's life. I believe that human's life span will be continually increasing with scientifically and technological advancements.
