	Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.
	

In most universities, students are required to register both prescribed and optional courses. Except for classes, an ordinary college student's daily life is filled with assignments, examinations, parties and games. When conflicts come up, it's hard to decide whether to attend classes or not. In my perspective, attending classes should be optional.

Not every class is necessary for students to take. On one hand, students have the right to drop a class when the class become boring and helpless. Time is invaluable. Spending an whole afternoon in reading a book in a library is much more meaningful than falling asleep in a lifeless classroom. When Einstein was in his high school, he made up a lot of excuses to escape from his physics classes. However, he got high scores on physics again and again, he explained that reading and thinking independently gave him more chances to image and challenge. On the other hand, students have to deal with something more urgent. It's very common that a student gets a interview via telephone after he sends out an application mail. None of interviewers are willing to wait for a candidate to finish his/her class. Compared to losing a job or internship opportunity, leaving the classroom to start the interview is obviously a wiser choice. Hence, it dose not make sense to require students to attend every class.

Lecturers should improve their skills to attract students. When a class can not attract enough students, its lecturer should review his/her performance and skills. It's reasonable for students to quit a class to express their dissatisfaction, as students deserve professional lecturers. In a higher education experiment, teachers in a college were asked to punish students who are absent from classes. After a couple of weeks, students did not came back, but more students chose to leave. Students lost interests to classes with punishment, while teachers have no idea about how to promote their courses. The experiment's failure indicates that it is essential for both students and universities to allow absences in classes.

If students have flexible schedules, they learn to manage their time well; if lectures find students keep leaving classes, they examine their educating methods and make changes for satisfying students. All in all, it's significant to keep attending classes optional.
