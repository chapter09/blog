	Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? 
	People today spend too much time on personal enjoyment-doing things they like to do-rather than doing things they should do. 
	Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.
	
	Along with the development of our society, people living in a high-pace life are under high pressure. To relax themselves or to evade pressures, they spend much more time on personal enjoyment activities rancher than what they should do. It's reasonable to enjoy oneself and get some rest, but modern people are not walking on a right way.
	
	First and foremost, more and more people are excessively addicted to the virtual social networks on Internet. Internet helps people experience a virtual world freely and conveniently. At the origin of social networks on Internet, people could make new friends and share stories and photos with each other. However, when people have more and more connections in the on-line social networks, Internet are becoming an endless black hole that eats up people's limited time. People who keeps twittering their intermediate feelings or sharing their photos on Facebook, but seldom asks friends for a cup of coffee or outdoors. Even on family gathering, people are silent but typing on their smart phones to keep connected on Internet. What's wrong with them? People care more about how many "like"s they receive on Facebook, than families and friends around.
	
	Additionally, more and more stupid shows or series are prevailing on TVs. people are willing to spend days and nights to follow those TV programs but never consider to spend an hour in a gym to build their bodies. Indeed, laying in a cozy sofa and watching meaningless TV shows seem like being much more appealing. Nonetheless, keeping healthy and energetic is important for both working and living. I have an uncle who ran a supermarket years ago, his daily work occupied most of his time. After work he drove home and had dinner in a sofa with the TV on. He said there was always satisfying programs there and he didn't want to miss. Unfortunately, last year, his doctor told him that his heart didn't work well and mainly because he seldom walked around and kept sitting for too much time everyday. For most people like my uncle, it's time to wake up from those TV programs, and to embrace meaningful life.
	
	All in all, when people are enjoying themselves on Internet or TV shows, they ought to keep their family and friends in mind, as well as their own health. Only can people learn to manage their time scientifically, they would come back to a balanced life
