	We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker(someone you work closely with)? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.
	
	
Along with the development of our society and industry, more and more business is deeply relied on cooperations. An brilliant co-worker not only offers essential tips in daily work, but also leaves inspiration and encouragement. As far as I know, excellent co-workers share some important characteristics.

First of all, being willing to share is one of the important characteristics for a good co-worker. In a highly developed society, most jobs are finished by cooperation while most knowledge is exchanged by sharing. Sharing is a highly efficient method to build a professional team. In a team, Veterans share their valuable experience with newbies to avoid obstacles in work; in response, newbies import fresh ideas and concepts into the team. When I was an intern, both my mentor Jason and I worked on the same project. Jason was a talkative and energetic guy. When he came up with some innovative ideas or learned some useful skills, he was delighted to share with me. Through cooperating with him, I learned a lot as well as shared a lot. We both improved ourselves largely.

Secondly, a welcomed co-worker is also a good listener. When we have questions or troubles, he or she is patient enough to listen to the whole story and gives their honest analysis and advice. Nowadays, when people with different background work together, conflicts happen inevitably. However, as long as we open our mind and listen to each other sincerely, problems will be well solved. Today Apple is one of the most valuable IT companies in the world, its former legend CEO Steve Jobs was an advocator for the art of listening. In Apple, before the release of a production, staff from various groups like User Experience Group, Hardware Adjustment Group and Operating System Group would exchange ideas about the production together and listen to each other carefully. In fact, Apple can hardly build so many great productions without listening to the voices from different groups. Therefore, listening is a necessary skill for a qualified co-worker.

In short, modern society requires people to cooperate much more closely than before. As we can see,  Thus, a good co-worker is fairly important.
