I run the SparkPi with `sbt` incremental compilation on, and result in the follow errors:

```bash

```

It is weird because all failed executors are from `10.2.3.5`, which is the Spark master node, also the node I am doing incremental compilation. 

Then I am wondering maybe itâ€™s the resource shortage that leads to the executor failures. Then I check the available memory with incremental compilation on, which is around 2 GB, while I assigned 4 GB to an executor. I then assigned only 2GB to the executor, and launch SparkPi. It succeed ! I have located the problem.
