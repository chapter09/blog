Delicious foods not only provide the necessary nutrients for people's daily life, but also bring happiness. Having a meal at a restaurant is convenient and pleasant, while homemade foods are much healthier and more economical. Therefore, I prefer to eating at home. 

Firstly, it's healthier and more flexible to eat at home. All the vegetables and meats are selected carefully by people who cooks for themselves and families, which guarantees the quality of the ingredients. However, every year a great number of people are sent to hospitals unfortunately because the dishes served in restaurants are not fresh enough. Considering most restaurants seek the maximum profit, eating at home becomes an economical but low-risk choice. Besides, people can decide flexibly the amount of condiments added to the meals at home, like salt and mustard. It's nearly impossible for any restaurants to adapt to every guest's taste.

Secondly, cooking at home is a way to relax and have fun. It is said cooking is one style of arts. Many people enjoy cooking because yummy foods fulfill their appetite, what's more important, those enjoyable dishes are made by their own. It takes more time to have meals at home than in restaurants indeed, but the whole progress of cooking is a good way to relax and have fun. Imaging when the kitchen is filled with the smell of steaks, families or friends turn to be hungry immediately and can't wait to start the meal, what an hilarious and unforgettable moment it is for families and friends. In addition, sharing special cooking tips with friends during a meal is very helpful for socializing. Thus, eating at home promotes the relationship between families and friends and makes life happier and easier.

Meanwhile, there are also a lot of people eating at restaurants, because they have limited time or they do not know how to cook. But once they experience having a healthy and delicious meal with friends and families at home, they forgets the dishes from restaurants at once.
