Delicious foods not only provide the necessary nutrients for people's daily life, but also bring vivid memories. Having a meal at a restaurant is convenient and pleasant, while homemade foods are much healthier and more economical. Therefore, I prefer to eat at home. 

Firstly, eating at home is beneficial for one's fitness. For people eating at home, All the vegetables and meats are selected and cleaned carefully by people themselves, which guarantees the quality of the ingredients. Every year a great number of people are sent to hospitals unfortunately because the foods served in restaurants are not fresh enough. Considering most restaurants seek the maximum profit, eating at home becomes an economical but low-risk choice. Besides, people can decide flexibly the amount of condiments added to the meals at home, like salt and mustard. It's nearly impossible for any restaurants to adapt to every guest's taste.

Secondly, cooking at home is a way to relax and have fun. Cooking is regarded as an art style widely. Many people enjoy cooking because yummy foods fulfill their appetite, what's more important is that those enjoyable dishes are made by their own. It takes more time to have meals at home than in restaurants indeed, but the whole progress of cooking is a progress to relax. Imaging when the kitchen is filled with the smell of steaks, families or friends turn to be hungry immediately and all of them can't wait to start the meal, what a hilarious and unforgettable moment it is for families and friends. In addition, sharing special cooking tips with friends during a meal is very helpful for socializing. Thus, eating at home with families and friends makes life happier and easier.

Meanwhile, there are also a lot of people eating at restaurants, because they have limited time or they do not know how to cook. But after they experience having a happy and delicious meal with friends and families at home, they will forget about restaurants at once.
