In the most time, once I start to search some knowledge on Internet via my Chrome, tabs will reproduce themselves to a large scale., which will bring your memory occupation up to about 90%. You know tens of tabs, in addition, some extensions also count.

Usually, most of the tabs I will not review again, but they won't be closed as I always think that I will open it again at some time or I do not want to dismiss the URL of that page.

Thus, my Chrome is always in chaos, and I also lost my efficiency.

Now I find a excellent extension called **Tab Wrangler**, which is the fifth one.

It will close your tabs automatically according to the time that the tab lives, of course, you can set up the time thread threshold and the max number of tabs can live through.

Worry about losing your previous browser pages or URLs? The Tab Wrangler will maintain a list that records tabs that it closed. You can restore those tabs by clicking the item in the list, it's very convenient .
